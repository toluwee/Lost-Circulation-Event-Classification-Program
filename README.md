# Lost-Circulation-Event-Classification-Program
Application of a Supervised Machine Learning Classification Technique to Drilling Operations 

## Objective

*   To forecast and categorize lost circulation severity using a large drilling dataset
*   To apply clearly interpretable machine learning algorithms in a reproducible manner to a drilling engineering case study.
*  To identify best machine learning classification techniques with good prediction accuracy for this dataset. 

## About The Dataset
This study makes use of a dataset provided by Mardanirad et al. (2021) generated from twenty wells drilled into Iran's Azadegan oilfield. The authors had removed all missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data from the dataset. 
The dataset comprises of 65,376 data records, each of which contains values for seventeen numerical drilling fluid and mechanical variables.
